Finally came the long awaited weekend after a week of MHS. I woke up at 1.30pm. I could not believe that I actually woke up so late. I missed the chance to spend an afternoon at Mid Valley. Seniors have promised to bring the freshies to Mid Valley. So I just stayed in my dorm for the whole day afterwards.

First I washed my one week worth of clothes and hanged them out in the sun. Then I tidied up my room until night time. Feeling a bit guilty wasting my whole day just in my room, I went to take a walk up the hill outside my college. Along the road were big trees. It was quiet and calming, like taking a walk in a forest. After that I ate dinner the the cafetaria.

The next day is a Sunday. Sunny and I with two other girls took the 11am bus to DTC. The KMMians were having the first gathering of UMians. We were the first few to reach, then joined by JJ, WR and a few other girls wearing the same T-shirt. We took the chance to take some photos while waiting for the arrival of others. We took a some sort of continuous selfie.

Met with my classmate from KMM. It was time to go so my cousin, Baby, Euge and I shared a Grab car. While waiting we met with two women who came up to us to introduce their event. They had Baby's phone number before we managed to get away.

All UMians gather back together and met with UKMians and we went our separate paths. I followed Sunn, SZK, WR and MZ. We had lunch in the cafeteria upstairs, joined by WR's friend. We met up with ZW at the centre ring before
