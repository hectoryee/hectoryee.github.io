Spyder works better for a project with large codebase. It comes with an Editor to write code, a Console to evaluate it and view the results at any time, a Variable Explorer to examine the variables defined during evaluation, and several other facilities to help you effectively develop the programs you need as a scientist.
 
## [Install Spyder from anaconda](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/spyder)
``` bash
conda install -c anaconda spyder 
```

## Running Spyder:
``` bash
spyder ~/project/fyp/kaggle

# with project
spyder -p ~/project/fyp/kaggle/python_file/
```
