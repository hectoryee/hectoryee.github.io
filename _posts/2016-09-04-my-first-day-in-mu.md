Today is my first study day in MU after a week of orientation. The very first class is The Fundamentals of Programming. We were taught about what is programming, pseudocode and flowchart. Theses are the basics or the skills that we should have as a programmers so that we know how to solve problems, or more precisely the process from input to output.

After class Sun, Author, Tall and me went to the main library for a visit. I found that MU library uses Ubuntu desktop which came as a surprise. Didn't know searching book can be this easy using the program. The first two books that I had borrowed were Thinking in Java and Javascript A beginner's Guide.

After that the four of us had lunch at UMEC Lunchbox. Met two other girls. Waited for like half an hour before we get our lunch. I tried out Chicken Rice. Not all that bad but seeing it was defroze and the sauce provided was gel-like somehow diminish the tastiness.

I had Citra class after that so I went to search for it and after running around a few places only did I found out that it was located at APM.

After class I went to the main library again to search for Head First Java but instead found MW who asked me to join him to the night market at SS2 along with his friends. So the six of us Grab two cars (RM11) and and off we went. Had dinner there tried out the charxiu and shaorou still Ok. After a stroll then we went back this time we called Uber for a seven seater (RM15).
